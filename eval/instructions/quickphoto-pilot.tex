\section{Introduction}
Today you will be playing the role of one of the developers of
QuickPhoto, a small application for manipulating images. Your
development team has just installed a new Eclipse plugin for working
with duplicate code, and is vetting the tool for use during software
development and maintenance.

Over the next 40 - 60 minutes, you will be adding a new feature to the
QuickPhoto application, and fixing a bug that a user has found. After
performing these two tasks, you will answer questions about the tasks
you just performed.

\section{Application Overview}
\todo{Rough overview of the application architecture. Mention that the
  user should feel free to modify the code except for code in classes
  X Y and Z}

\section{Duplicate Code Plugin}
The duplicate code plugin detects when similar code appears in
multiple places in a project. For each region of similar code, it may
recommend four different actions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Insert a method call to the method containing the similar code
  \item Create a new method that contains the similar code (method extraction)
  \item Open an editor that is focused on the similar code, and
  \item Paste the similar code, substituting identifiers as needed
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Plugin Modes}
The tool has a development mode, and a maintenance mode; these modes
can be toggled using the toolbar. In development mode, the tool only
marks similar code in the region where the last file edit happened
(where you are developing). In maintenance mode, the tool marks all of
the similar code in the active file.

\section{Development (approx. 20 minutes)}


You have been tasked with adding a new feature to QuickPhoto.


\section{Maintenance (approx. 20 minutes)}



\section{Reflection (approx. 20 minutes)}

Please type the answers the following questions about the
recommendations provided by the tool, and the actions that you
performed when performing the development and maintenance tasks.

\paragraph{Similar Code Suggestions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you find the duplicate code tool's suggestions helpful?
    Why, or why not? Does your answer differ for the development and
    maintenance tasks? If so, why?
  \item Was the ranking (ordering) of the tool's suggestions valid?
    Why, or why not? Does your answer differ for the development and
    maintenance tasks? If so, why?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Method Extraction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If you extracted a method, how did you decide to extract the
    method? 
  \item If you chose not to extract a method, why did you decide not
    to extract the method?
\end{enumerate}
